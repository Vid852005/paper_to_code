This repo contains all my projects that have been done by interpreting research papers from the viewpoint of coding.
The motivation behind this is to read , understand and analyse research papers to develop understanding and logic of the researh papers
We will do the following topics for papers step by step :
  1. **CNN**
  2. **RNN**
  3. **LSTM**
  4. **GRU**
  5. **GAN**
  6. **Transformer** (especially *'attention is all you need'*)
  7. **LLM**
  8. **VLM**

Every project will be either based on one topic or a combination of multiple topics
