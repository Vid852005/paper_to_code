This repo contains all my projects that have been done by interpreting research papers from the viewpoint of coding.
The motivation behind this is to read , understand and analyse research papers to develop understanding and logic of the researh papers
We will do the following topics for papers step by step :
  . CNN
  . RNN
  . LSTM
  . GRU
  . GAN
  . Transformer (especially 'attention is all you need')
  . LLM
  . VLM

Every project will be either based on one topic or a combination of multiple topics
